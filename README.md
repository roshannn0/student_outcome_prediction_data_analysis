# student_outcome_prediction_data_analysis

This project focuses on identifying the key determinants of student academic success by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of university records within a Jupyter Notebook environment. Using Python and the Pandas library, the raw data undergoes a rigorous cleansing process to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize attributes, ensuring that factors such as demographics, study habits, and attendance are accurately formatted for analysis. This foundational step transforms unstructured information into a clean, reliable dataset ready for deep statistical exploration.

Following the data preparation, the project utilizes Matplotlib to generate visualizations—such as bar charts and scatter plots—that illustrate correlations between student behaviors and their grades. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the system highlights specific trends, enabling the prediction of academic outcomes based on identified variables like study time or participation in extracurricular activities. The final result is a data-driven insight model that not only maps out current performance metrics but also predicts future success rates, providing actionable intelligence for educational stakeholders.
